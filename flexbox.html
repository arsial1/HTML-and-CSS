            When flexbox was developed a couple of years ago, the main idea
            behind it was to basically allow browsers to automatically divide
            empty space inside some container element by its child elements. And
            by doing that, the browser takes away a lot of work that previously
            the web developers had to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this post, let's focus on Flexbox. We will learn what Flexbox is
            all about, and why you too should learn and use it.
          </p>
          <h3>What is Flexbox?</h3>
          <p>
            Flexbox, short for Flexible Box Layout, is a one-dimensional layout
            model in CSS that offers a more efficient way to lay out, align, and
            distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is
            unknown or dynamic.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a powerful tool designed to accommodate complex layouts and
            alignments that were difficult to achieve with traditional CSS
            properties alone. Flexbox makes it easier to design flexible
            responsive layout structures without having to use floats or
            positioning.
          </p>

          <h3>How to use Flexbox?</h3>
          <p>
            There are not many concepts behind flexbox that you need to
            understand in order to start using it. But here is what you do need
            to know.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, first of all, the element on which we want to use flexbox is
            called the flex container. All we have to do in order to create a
            flex container is to set display property of container to flex. And
            that's it.
          </p>
          <pre>
          <code class="language-css code">
            
            .container {
                display: flex;
            }
          </code>
        </pre>

          <p>
            if we do this, then all the direct children of that flex container
            will become the so-called flex items.
          </p>
          <p>
            By default flex items are aligned to main axis (horizontal) but we
            can change the direction of flexbox axis from horizontal to
            vertical, so we can align elements/flex items along the main axis
            and along the cross axis in different ways.
          </p>
          <p>We always need to know which axis we are dealing with.</p>
          <h3>Overview of all Flexbox properties</h3>
          <p>
            Overview of all the CSS properties that are part of the flexbox
            specification both for the flex container and for the flex items.
          </p>
          <p>
            So for the flex container, the most important ones are the
            <strong>gap</strong>, the <strong>justify-content</strong> and the
            <strong>align-items</strong> properties.
          </p>
          <pre>
          <code class="language-css code">
            
            .container {
                display: flex;
                align-items: center;
                justify-content: space-between;
                gap: 20px;
            }
            
          </code>
        </pre>
          <p>
            There are three other properties that we can apply on the flex
            container element, which are <strong>flex-direction</strong>,
            <strong>flex-wrap</strong>, and <strong>align-content</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In properties for flex-items, <strong>align-auto</strong> is pretty
            important because it can override the
            <strong>align-items</strong>property
          </p>
          <p>
            Then we have these other ones which are <strong>flex-grow</strong>,
            <strong>flex-shrink</strong>, <strong>flex-basis</strong>.
            <strong>flex</strong> is the recommended shorthand for
            <strong>flex-grow</strong>, <strong>flex-shrink</strong> and
            <strong>flex-basis</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flexbox allows flex items to flex (grow or shrink) to fill available
            space in the container. This is particularly useful for creating
            responsive designs that adjust and adapt to different screen sizes.
          </p>
          <h3>Why should you learn Flexbox?</h3>
          <p>
            There are countless and compelling reasons for learning and using
            Flexbox:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong> Responsive Design:</strong> Flexbox makes it much easier
              to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes
              and devices. This is essential in today's world where users access
              websites on a variety of devices, from smartphones to desktop
              computers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Simplified Layouts:</strong> Flexbox simplifies complex
              layout tasks that were traditionally challenging with CSS alone.
              With Flexbox, you can easily create complex layouts with less
              code, making your development process more efficient and your code
              easier to maintain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Flexibility and Control:</strong> Flexbox gives you
              fine-grained control over the alignment, ordering, and sizing of
              elements within a container. This level of control allows you to
              create visually appealing designs that were previously difficult
              to achieve.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Future-Proofing:</strong> While newer layout methods like
              CSS Grid are gaining popularity, Flexbox is still widely used and
              will continue to be relevant for the foreseeable future. By
              mastering Flexbox, you'll have a solid foundation in modern web
              layout techniques that will serve you well in your career.
